# Conrad Assistant

This project aims to help you create your own Google Home through the use of a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino Nano and some cheap components such as a USB soundcard, speaker and microphone. The project was developed in partnership with [Conrad](https://www.conrad.se/) in their efforts to showcase makers around Sweden. I would therefore like to thank them for providing the hardware used in this project. Please also check out [their website](http://tekkie.se/) for more interesting projects. I would also like to thank Eric Vinjegaard for his work on the 3D-printed chassi and Jirka van der Roest for his work on the Arduino code.

### Usage
Clone the project and open up the Arduino project. Flash this to your Arduino Nano and you're good to go. The pins used are 5V, GND and D6 and the baudrate is set to 115200 by default.
